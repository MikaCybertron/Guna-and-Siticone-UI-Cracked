## UIBypass

Previously named CrackedUI.

This aims to remove both Guna and Siticone (and most other clones) UI License windows from appearing.
the windows are annoying and don't let you move them or close them until 10 seconds of precious time
has past. Luckily this program I developed will remove the windows by hiding them.
